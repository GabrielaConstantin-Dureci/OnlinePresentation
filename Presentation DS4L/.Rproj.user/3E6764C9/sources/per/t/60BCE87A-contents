# Abstract 

--

**I am including the abstract to provide more context for this study.** 

--

The current study examines how listeners make gradient and variable ethnolinguistic judgments 
in an experimental context where the speaker’s identity is well-known. It features an open-guise experiment (Soukup, 2013) that assessed whether sociolinguistic judgments are subject to 
incrementality, with judgments increasing in magnitude as variable stimuli demonstrate more 
extreme differences. In particular, this task tested whether judgments of President Barack Obama 
as sounding ‘more’ or ‘less’ black (e.g., Alim & Smitherman, 2012) are sensitive to differences in 
intonation. Half of critical stimuli featured an L+H* pitch accent, which occurs more frequently in 
African American Language than in Mainstream U.S. English (Holliday, 2016). Four stimuli apiece 
were created from these phrases by making each pitch accent more extreme by semitone-based F0 steps. Seventy-nine listeners rated these stimuli via the question, “How black does 
Obama sound here?” Mixed-effects modeling indicated that listeners rated more phonetically 
extreme L+H* stimuli as sounding blacker, regardless of listener identity. A post-hoc analysis 
found that listeners attended to different voice quality features in L+H* stimuli. We discuss 
implications for research in intonation, ethnic identification, incrementality, language attitudes, 
and sociolinguistic awareness.

# Background for the study (1)

--

- Perceptual sociolinguistic/ sociophonetic study 

--

- It employs the auto-segmental/metrical (AM) intonational framework 
(Pierrehumbert, 1980) 

--

- Intonational variation serves to index various ethnic identities (Burdin, 
2015; Holliday, 2016; Reed, 2016) 

--

- U.S. listeners can distinguish African American and white voices (see Thomas and Reaser, 2004) 

--

 - rather accurately (70-100%)

--

- However, speaker-specific variables are difficult to pinpoint (Holliday and Jaggers, 2015)

---

# Background for the study (2)

--

- In production studies, the L + H* pitch accent - resource for performance of African American identity (Holliday, 2016). 

--

- L+H* has been identified as more prevalent in AAL (African American Language) than in MAE (Mainstream American English). 

--

- Previous studies have not considered the *incrementality* of social meaning.

--

  -  One reason is that socially marked variables (e.g., /ɹ/ vocalization) have been predominantly viewed as categorical (e.g., present or absent) instead of gradient.

--

- This study examines how listeners:

 - evaluate ethnicity based on intonational variation 
 
 - assign social meaning to gradient phonetic variation.

---

# Description of the study 

--

- Listeners rated speech samples of former U.S. President Barack Obama "on the degree of *sounding black*" (p. 2) 

--

 - Obama is known to be able to command both AAL and MAE varieties (Alim and Smitherman, 2012)

- The critical stimuli included at least *one or more* *L+H* * *pitch* *accents or no* *L+H* * *pitch accents*. 

--

## Research Questions 

--

1. How do pitch accents affect listener judgments of ethnic identity? In particular, does the L+H* pitch accent carry a social meaning of blackness in perception, as it does in production?

--

2. To what extent are the ethnicity-based social meanings of these pitch accents mediated by incremental phonetic differences?

--

3. What other aspects of voice quality affect listener judgments of ethnicity?

---

# Methodology (1)

--

- Perceptual task

--

 - open-guise technique (OGT) (Soukup, 2013)

--

 - - "relative" of the MGT (matched-guise test)

 - - Participants are informed that they are listening to the same speaker in different guises

 - Since the stimulus speaker was former U.S. President Barack Obama, the assumption was that the listeners (all from the U.S.) would be familiarized with his voice.

 - - An OGT was deemed more appropriate than an MGT.

# Methodology (2)

--

.pull-left[
### Materials

- 120 stimuli based on excerpts of Barack Obama's spontaneous speech from two different TV interviews from 2016

 - each stimulus based on a single Intonational Phrase (IP) unit
 - - ranging from 0.4 to 2.3 seconds (median: 0.9 seconds)
]

--

.pull-right[
### Task design

- online survey
- listeners heard a single stimulus auto-play twice
- then they responded to the question "How black or white does Obama sound here?" on a continuous unit-less slider bar
 - "very black" and "very white" on opposite poles
 ]

---

# Statistical analysis (1)

--

- comparison of linear mixed-effects models of standardized ratings to find the predictor structure that best modeled the data in critical trials
 - the predictors tested were:
  - phrase types (H(star) versus L+H(star))
  - manipulation step
  - edge tone
  - nuclear pitch
  - stimulus duration
  - numerous listener effects (e.g., participants' race, gender, etc.)
  
--

### For this presentation, I am reporting only *phrase type* and *manipulation step*.

Table 1 summarizes the best model for listener rates of blackness for the following predictors: phrase type, manipulation step, and their interaction.
